# KShoppingList


This is a "back to the basics" experiment project where I'll be creating a shopping list app to refresh many basic, advance and new concepts of Android SDK and Kotlin.

The project will be designed and developed from the scratch.  All the resources used to build this project will be updated in this files as they are used during the project.

## What to take from the project if you follow along:
* Latest UI practices.
* Latest Kotlin features
* Latest Android SDK features
* Firebase database implementation
 

Note: This will be the first time that I'll be doing an open source project development, progress of which I will be updating every now and then on my Twitter and LinkedIn so please be easy on me any suggestions are most welcome.
