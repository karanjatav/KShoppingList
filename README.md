# KShoppingList


This is a "back to the basics" experiment project where I'll be creating a shopping list app to refresh many basic, advance and new concepts of Android SDK and Kotlin.

The project will be designed and developed from the scratch.  All the resources used to build this project will be updated in this files as they are used during the project.

## What to take from the project if you follow along:
* Latest UI practices.
* Latest Kotlin features
* Latest Android SDK features
* FireStore Cloud (Firebase database) implementation
 

## Firebase Database
As I cannot share my Firebase account publicly I m adding image below on how I have set it up on the Firestore Cloud.

<img alt="Model_1" src="/categories_model.PNG" width="33%"> <img alt="Model_2" src="/items_model.PNG" width="33%"> <img alt="Model_3" src="/selected_item_model.PNG" width="33%">

<b> You will have to generate a "google-services.json" from firebase and add it to this project in app folder.</b>

## Resources
Updated blue print/design of the project which I'll keep adding screens into and you can open it using https://app.diagrams.net:
